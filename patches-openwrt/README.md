# OpenWrt patches

The patches in this directory and subdirectories are based on OpenWrt, created with quilt.
They are based on commit ca5c695a4522091234026e22e8336f05d65602ba as HEAD of master branch
in OpenWrt git.

Patches with the word 'UPSTREAM' in name are already included in the latest Linux
kernel since 5.19, but not yet in OpenWrt as it does not yet use this version.
